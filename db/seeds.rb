# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# events = Event.all
# guests = Guest.all
#
# events.destroy_all
# guests.destroy_all
#
# 11.times do |event_num|
#
#   my_event = Event.create(name: "fake Event #{event_num}", address: "1800 19th st NE", city: "Washington, DC", day: 2, month: 27, year: 2017, start_time: "11:00pm", end_time: '4:00am', description: "best time ever!!!!!!!!", img_url: 'http://allimagespictures.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/21684.gif')

#   30.times do |guest_num|
#
#     my_event.guests.create(name: "fake guest#{guest_num}", email: "fake_guest#{guest_num}@fakefakefakestuff.com", message: "i'll be there!!!")
